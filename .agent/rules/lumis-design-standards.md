# Lumis UI Design Standards
- **Source of Truth:** Always reference the images in `/public/design` for UI, layout, and styling tasks.
- **Visual Aesthetic:** Adopt the soft gradients and minimalist "pastel-morning" vibe found in `IMG_9311.png` and `IMG_9312.png`.
- **Component Mapping:**
  - Use the "Activity Selection" pattern from `IMG_9311.png` for all feature selection screens.
  - Use the "Circular Tracking" radar from `IMG_9312.png` for the active sunlight tracking dashboard.
  - Use the homepage design from `IMG_9295.png` for the homepage.
  - Use the design from `IMG_9298.png` for the how it works and lux meter design.

- **Verification:** Before finalizing any UI code, capture a screenshot and compare it against the reference images to ensure alignment.
