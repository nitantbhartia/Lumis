        <h1>Lumis Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 20, 2026</p>
        <p>At Lumis, we believe your habits and data belong to you. This policy outlines how we handle your information.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data Minimization & Local Storage</h2>
        <p>Lumis is designed with a privacy-first architecture. All sensitive data regarding your app usage, blocked
            apps list, and daily habits is processed and stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud via
            CloudKit. We do not maintain external servers that store your personal usage logs.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Screen Time & Family Controls APIs</h2>
        <p>Lumis utilizes the <strong>Family Controls</strong> and <strong>Managed Settings</strong> frameworks provided
            by Apple. This usage is strictly limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allowing you to voluntarily select specific apps to "shield" or block during your morning routine.</li>
            <li>Enforcing these blocks temporarily until your sunlight goal is met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do not track which apps you have installed, nor do we monitor your browsing
            history or app usage duration for marketing or analytics purposes.</p>

        <h2>3. Health Data (HealthKit)</h2>
        <p>With your explicit permission, Lumis reads data from Apple Health (specifically step count and outdoor time)
            to verify your activity. This data is used solely to update your progress rings within the app and is not
            shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>4. Location Data</h2>
        <p>Your precise location is used transiently to fetch accurate local weather, sunrise, and sunset times. This
            ensures your circadian advice is relevant to your environment. We do not track or store your location
            history.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at support@lumis.app.</p>
